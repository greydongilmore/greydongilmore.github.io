      <description>Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to benefit individuals living with Parkinson disease. The STN is a very small surgical target (7.0mm x 4.0mm), which makes targeting the nucleus very difficult. Furthermore, the sensorimotor subdivision of the STN is the optimal target location for optimal clinical motor symptom improvement. This subdivision is a much smaller region located in the dorso-lateral aspect, recent studies have show characteristic signal features in this area.</description>
