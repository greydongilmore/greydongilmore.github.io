      <description>The effectiveness of the DBS device is highly dependent on the proper radiologic and electrophysiological identification of DBS target structures and the accurate placement of the DBS electrodes. However, the current restrictions on the postoperative MRI of electrodes has resulted in many centers opting out of the procedure. This project aims to provide evidence that these restrictions are unnecessarily strict, providing low quality MRI images that make locating electrodes very difficult.</description>

      <description>Optimal targeting of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for Parkinson disease is essential to the clinical outcome. Machine learning, using single and multi-unit spike recordings from the operating room, will be used to estimate STN boundaries and optimal electrode placement.</description>
