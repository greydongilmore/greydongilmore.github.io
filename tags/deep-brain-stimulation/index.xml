      <description>Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to benefit individuals living with Parkinson disease. The STN is a very small surgical target (7.0mm x 4.0mm), which makes targeting the nucleus very difficult. Furthermore, the sensorimotor subdivision of the STN is the optimal target location for optimal clinical motor symptom improvement. This subdivision is a much smaller region located in the dorso-lateral aspect, recent studies have show characteristic signal features in this area.</description>

      <title>Imaging With DBS Electrodes</title>

      <description>The effectiveness of the DBS device is highly dependent on the proper radiologic and electrophysiological identification of DBS target structures and the accurate placement of the DBS electrodes. However, the current restrictions on the postoperative MRI of electrodes has resulted in many centers opting out of the procedure. This project aims to provide evidence that these restrictions are unnecessarily strict, providing low quality MRI images that make locating electrodes very difficult.</description>
