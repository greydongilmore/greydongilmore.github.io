      <description>The effectiveness of the DBS device is highly dependent on the proper radiologic and electrophysiological identification of DBS target structures and the accurate placement of the DBS electrodes. However, the current restrictions on the postoperative MRI of electrodes has resulted in many centers opting out of the procedure. This project aims to provide evidence that these restrictions are unnecessarily strict, providing low quality MRI images that make locating electrodes very difficult.</description>
